## About The Project

<br /><br />
The 8-puzzle consists of a 3x3 grid containing 8 tiles numbered from 1 to 8 and one blank space. The objective is to move the tiles around the grid by sliding them into the blank space in order to achieve a specific goal state, typically where the tiles are arranged in numerical order.

The puzzle begins with a random configuration of the tiles, and the player can only move tiles horizontally or vertically into the blank space. 

In `src`, you can find different solutions solving the puzzle: Greedy and A* algorithm.
